This app uses Azure to store images, show them in the broswer, add information that can be found in the dropdowns and then converts the image to a PDF.

Tech used:
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript 
- jsPDF
- html2canvas
- Microsoft Azure

Next stage is using images stored in Azure blob, looping through them dynamically and updating the dropdowns and images.
